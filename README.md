## Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of neural network used for generative learning. They consist of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other to produce realistic data. This repository provides an example of using GANs for various computer vision applications, leveraging the power of neural networks to create new images.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gan-computer-vision.git
cd gan-computer-vision
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To run the GAN example, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset and place the images in the data directory.

Run the main.py script to train the GAN model and generate new images:
bash```
python main.py
```
## Results
The results of the GAN training and image generation tasks will be saved in the results directory. You can visualize the generated images and evaluate the performance of the model.
